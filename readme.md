# IMODAL

IMODAL is a python library allowing to register shapes (curves, meshes, images) with **structured large deformations**. The structures are incorporated via **deformation modules** which generate vector fields of particular, chosen types. They can be defined *explicitly* (generating local scalings or rotations for instance) or *implicitly* from constraints. In addition, it is possible to combine them so that a complex structure can be easily defined as the superimposition of simple ones. Trajectories of such modular vector fields can then be integrated to build *modular large deformations*. Their parameters can be optimized to register observed shapes and analyzed.
